# NENA Industry COllaboration Events (ICE)
Working Repository for public documentation of NENA ICE events.
NENA is dedicated to ensuring that the goals of NG9-1-1, both technical and non-technical, are met. NENA views a range of testing programs as a critical component to accomplishing standards based NG9-1-1. NENA understands that it is the vendors of NG9-1-1 elements that will ultimately deliver the interoperability NG9-1-1 promises. Therefore, NG9-1-1 testing events sponsored by NENA are aimed at supporting the vendors in their testing with each other. These Industry Collaboration Events (ICE) bring together vendors in an open, supportive, and collaborative, environment that foster a spirit of technical cooperation. Taking part in or success in testing at an ICE event does not confer any formal NENA certification for a vendorâ€™s products.
