We have four simulated regions in a model where three regional ECRF vendors share a region each, including two forest guides, operating a fragmented nationwide footprint simulation. 

Each region includes several authoritative state assignments and enough shared county boundary coverage to fulfill the needs for routing test calls. This includes enough data for an alternative model to use in case one or another peering fails at the FG layer. 

We have one dedicated Forest Guide vendor and one vendor performing both Regional and Forest Guide positions.

The three and optional fourth regional ECRF will handle queries from FE(s) in the test. Based on the combination of the location used and the Vendor selected during a test call, more appropriately, their coverage boundaries, the query will invoke the Forest Guide for many test runs.
