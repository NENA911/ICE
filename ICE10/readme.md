Event Held: October 24 – 28, 2022

Hosted and Supported By: Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), School of Technology, Real-Time Communications Lab, Wheaton, IL

NENA’s NG9-1-1 Industry Collaboration Event (ICE) series provides members of the public-safety vendor community with an opportunity to test implementations of NG9-1-1 standards in an open, collaborative, and neutral environment. The events are overseen by the ICE Steering Committee, which is a permanent representative body consisting of stakeholders from various public safety, non-profit, and vendor entities.

i3 version 3 was published in July 2021, alongside numerous other standards that were completed or will be completed around the same period. Version 3 brings numerous new features and fundamental changes to the overall architecture; chiefly, one of these is a move from SOAP / XML to REST / JSON for programmatic interfaces and data structures, which means that even functions that do not have any feature changes or additions may have a completely new interface. This means that many interactions that have been tested at previous events need to be re-evaluated at ICE 10.

Alongside i3v3, many other standards were also published at around the same time, and many are directly incorporated into i3. Considering that this presents a “next generation” of NG9-1-1, the ICE Steering Committee has chartered the 10th ICE event to focus on testing implementations of new and updated features in i3 version 3, as well as other specifications that i3 incorporates or relies on. Additionally, there are production implementations of NG9-1-1 in place at telecommunications carriers today, as well as within mobile device operating systems (think Android and iOS), and it is an additional goal of the ICE Steering Committee to test end-to-end implementations of i3 on production consumer equipment, carrier networks, NG9-1-1 core services and PSAP software, as much as feasible, at this and all our subsequent events.
